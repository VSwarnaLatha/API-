# API-
Creation of API using POST,GET,UPDATE,DELETE
I created api for the above mentioned methods using node js, by saving data in "NO SQL BOOSTER" (MongoDB), in my case 
"POSTMAN" acts as a UI for giving values for checking whether the data which i am giving in postman is
saving in MongoDB DataBase or not.
